# Goal:
The purpose of this repository is to create a program to enable selecting yoga poses for specific reasons. e.g. If you'd like to focus on back pains, you can use the function `find_poses_of_x_benefits` to target the poses with the specific anotomical benefit of back stretching.

# Data acquisition:
Yoga poses: 107 poses from [the Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arrowe/yoga-poses-dataset-107).
> Note: There are actually more than 107 Yoga poses in the wild. So the list grew longer as I discovered more Yoga poses.
Anotomical & Energetic benefits: acquired through ChatGPT.
> Note: Because of the hallucinating property of ChatGPT (LLM in general), some benefits are incorrect. Thus, additional judgement from a certified Yoga instructor is needed to confirm the benefits.

# Disclaimer:
1. Some info might be incorrect because of the hallucinating property of ChatGPT (LLM in general).
2. Yoga practice requires good judgement and guidance.


Thus, additional guidance from a certified Yoga instructor should be sought before performing the Yoga practice.
